PyPI Objects Reference
======================

These objects are used by :class:`pypiwrap.client.PyPIClient` and represent the data returned 
by the `PyPI JSON and Stats API <https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html>`_.

.. warning::
   There currently seems to be no PEP or standard formalizing the structure of this API.
   The documentation here comes mainly from inference. While it seems to have remained
   stable, changes may occur.
