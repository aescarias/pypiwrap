# Changelog

(versions follow [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html))

## [2.0.0] (2025-01-18)

pypiwrap 2.0 adds support for the PyPI RSS feeds and the current versions of the PyPI JSON API and the Simple Repository API.

### Additions

- Support for the PyPI RSS feeds.
- `IndexPage` which is now returned by `SimpleRepoClient.get_index_page`
- `Meta` (used by `IndexPage.meta` and `ProjectPage.meta`)
- Exceptions `ParseError` and `UnsupportedVersionError` and warning `UnexpectedVersionWarning`.
- `Project.dynamic` (PEP 643).
- `Project.license_expression` and `Project.license_files` (PEP 639).
- `Project.provides_extra` (PEP 566).
- `DistributionFile.gpg_url` and `DistributionFile.metadata_url`.
- `DistributionFile.provenance_url` (PEP 740).
- `ProjectPage.alternate_locations` (PEP 708).

### Changes

- Bumped minimum supported version to Python 3.9.
- `APIObject._from_raw` is now exposed as `APIObject.from_json`.
- Renamed `SimpleClient` to `SimpleRepoClient` and so:
  - `SimpleClient.get_index` -> `SimpleRepoClient.get_index_page`
  - `SimpleClient.get_page` -> `SimpleRepoClient.get_project_page`
- Cleaned up type hints and documentation.
- Moved constants in the `client` module to a new `consts` module (alongside some package metadata).

### Removals

The following fields have been removed as they have either been deprecated or are no longer relevant.

- `Project.bugtrack_url`: Unused [since sometime in 2014](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/233#issuecomment-37069593), hardcoded to None [since 2018](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/commit/b66d92985d42de2b2554ff7872ce4723860e1bd5), and formally deprecated [since 2023](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/13790). This field has been superseded by the `Project-Url` field in the Core Metadata specification (and hence, by `Project.project_urls`).
- `Project.home_page`: This field comes from the deprecated `Home-page` Core metadata field. Users should instead look for a homepage in `Project.project_urls`.
- `Project.docs_url`: Before sometime in 2016, PyPI allowed package authors to host their documentation on <https://pythonhosted.org>. This is no longer the case and so this field has been removed.
- `Project.download_url`: This field comes from a time when PyPI allowed package authors to host their package files at external URLs as PyPI did not have the facilities to do so initially. However, as PyPI gained this functionality later on, support for external hosting was removed with [PEP 470](https://peps.python.org/pep-0470/). This field is hence no longer relevant.
- `Project.package_url`: This field was added [seemingly for no reason](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/3206#issuecomment-371979438). It is effectively the same as `Project.project_url` and users should use that instead.
- `ReleaseFile.comment_text`: While users can still provide a comment using the Upload API, this field is rarely used and so has been removed.
- `ReleaseFile.has_sig`: PyPI has been moving away from GPG signatures in favor of attestations and trusted publishing. This field was formally deprecated in 2023 alongside `Project.bugtrack_url`.
- `utils.gpg_from_url`: Same reason as `ReleaseFile.has_sig`. The `DistributionFile.gpg_url` property serves a similar purpose.
- `JSON_URL`, `STATS_URL`, and `SIMPLE_URL`: These constants were unused and are now hardcoded.

## [1.1.0] (2023-11-04)

This release adds a few small changes to the API and cleans up the documentation of the project.

### Additions

- Clients now support a `host` parameter allowing users to provide an alternative host compatible with the APIs.
- Created a new `PYPI_HOST` constant.
- Added `DistributionFile.core_metadata` (PEP 714).

### Deprecations

- `JSON_URL`, `STATS_URL`, and `SIMPLE_URL`: These constants are no longer used by pypiwrap.
- `Project.bugtrack_url`: This is no longer reported by the API and always returns None. Users may consult for bugtracking URLs in `Project.project_urls`.
- `ReleaseFile.has_sig`: This is no longer reported by the API and always returns None. Users should simply add `.asc` at the end of `ReleaseFile.url` and perform a GET request.

### Fixes

- Addressed datetime conversion error for `upload_time` values not containing a microsecond component.

## [1.0.0] (2023-05-19)

This is the first major release :tada:. It adds some notable changes to the structure of the project.

### Additions

- Added `PyPIClient` (for the JSON and Stats API) and `SimpleClient` (for the Simple API) as replacements for `Client`.
  - `Client.get_project` -> `PyPIClient.get_project`
  - `Client.get_stats` -> `PyPIClient.get_stats`
  - `Client.get_all_projects` -> `SimpleClient.get_index`
  - `Client.get_files` -> `SimpleClient.get_page`
- Clients can now be used as context managers (`with` statement).
- Clients now report an appropriate user agent.
- Added `exceptions.raise_for_status` as a replacement for `exceptions.error_from_response`.
- Added `Vulnerability.withdrawn` attribute.
- Added `DistributionFile.size` and `DistributionFile.upload_time` (PEP 700).
- Added `ProjectPage` (PEP 700).
- Added some documentation to the utilities.

### Changes

- Renamed `Base` to `APIObject`
- Renamed `Size.from_bytes` to `Size.from_int` to avoid confusion with the builtin `bytes`.
- `Stats.top_packages` is now sorted by size.

### Removals

- `Client`: Its functionality has been split into `PyPIClient` and `SimpleClient`.
- `exceptions.error_from_response`: Now replaced by `exceptions.raise_for_status`.

## [0.3.0] (2022-11-01)

This release focuses on fixes and improvements to the pypiwrap package. This release can be considered stable.

### Additions

- Added representation (`__repr__`) to `Stats`.
- Added `utils.gpg_from_url`.

### Changes

- The following have been renamed to better align with the API's structure and terminology:
  - `PyPiClient` -> `Client`.
  - `Package` -> `Project`.
  - `ReleaseURL` -> `ReleaseFile`.
  - `PackageFile` -> `DistributionFile`.
  - `Client.get_package` -> `Client.get_project`.
  - `ReleaseFile.packagetype` -> `ReleaseFile.package_type`.
  - `DistributionFile.gpg_sig` -> `DistributionFile.has_sig` (to better align with `ReleaseFile.has_sig`).
- Updated docs for `ReleaseFile.python_version` to be clearer (along with other members).
- Migrated exceptions to a separate module (`exceptions`).

### Removals

- `ReleaseFile.md5_digest`: If needed, fetch from `ReleaseFile.digests` instead.

### Fixes

- Fixed incorrect type hint of `Project.requires_dist`.
- Fixed incorrect SI step size for `utils.bytes_to_readable`. Older versions used 1024 rather than the correct one (1000) as the step size for SI
- Fixed typos in documentation.

## [0.2.0] (2022-09-11)

This is a complete rewrite of the original project, designed with a more Pythonic approach and a simpler API.

### Additions

- Added `PyPiClient` as a replacement for the other API classes.
- Added the data classes `Base`, `Package`, `ReleaseURL`, `Vulnerability`, and `PackageFile`.
- Added the `NotFound` exception as a replacement for `PackageNotFound` and `VersionNotFound`.
- Added the `ClientError` exception.
- Added `utils.Size` for representing human-readable sizes.
- Added `utils.iso_to_datetime` for converting ISO 8601 strings to date times.
- Added `utils.remove_additional` for discarding unneeded fields.
- Added `Client.get_all_projects` and `Client.get_files` from the Simple API.

### Changes

- Switched to `setup.cfg` for package information.

### Removals

- Removed `MainAPI`. Users should use `PyPiClient` instead.
- Removed `PackageInfo` and `ReleaseInfo`. They have been merged into `PyPiClient` as `PyPiClient.get_package`.
- Removed `Statistics` and `TopPackage` in favor of a single `Stats` model.
- Removed `PackageNotFound` and `VersionNotFound` in favor of the new `NotFound` exception.
